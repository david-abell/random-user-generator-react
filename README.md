## React random user generator

Displays a random user bio pulled from the [random user generator api](https://randomuser.me)

## Why I built this

My first project with React. An exercise to showcase practical front end skills of api connection and async data processing.

## Project design goal

Use React to generate a random user profile from random user generator Json.

- The UI should initially show a 'get user' button which, when clicked, fetches random user data, parses the response json, saves it to a state variable, and displays a card from the resulting data.

- Below the card should be two buttons. A '`get new user`' / '`next user`' button, depending on whether the current displayed user is the most recently fetched user and '`previous user`'.

- When clicked, the '`get new user`' button should fetch a new user, set it as the most recent, and display it.

- There should also be a previous user that is only clickable after a second user is displayed. When clicked this button should display the previous user. The second button displayed should also change to '`next user`'.

- The '`next user`' button should be visible only when the user displayed is not the most recently fetched.

## Source

Data is fetched from the [random user generator api](https://randomuser.me)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

<!-- **Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
